<p>Service design of Transition from an EU cross-government services
Planned and conducted International research across multiple embassies
MVP definition Digital agile project from alpha to private beta
Definition of information architecture structure and interaction design
Led team of researchers and interaction designers</p>

<p>I led the design organization at Medium, branching the product design group with design research, as well as establishing an in-house brand and editorial design team. This unification of the different design practices is unique, and was a draw for both myself and many of the designers who joined the company over the course of the year. Media companies at Mediumâ€™s scale have a unique opportunity to have brand, content and product inform each other, rather than be separated by the walls of org division that plague larger institutions.</p>
