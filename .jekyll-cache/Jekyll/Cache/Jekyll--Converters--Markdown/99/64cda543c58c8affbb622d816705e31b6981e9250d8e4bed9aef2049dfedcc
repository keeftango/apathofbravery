<p>Advertising and recruiting teachers in the UK is expensive for the thousands of schools whoâ€™s only option is to use 3rd party platforms with incredibly expensive subscriptions. As lead UX consultant I was responsible for designing a centralised (and free) government platform for schools to recruit all teachers in the UK. From concept to beta as part of an agile delivery team, I led challenges on the effectiveness of search, key information mental models and improving key task usability. Across responsive mobile and web app usage, I led the design and research which heavily incorporated analytics as part of its decision framework. Mentoring junior researchers and interaction designers was also a key part of my role as the project scaled up.</p>
