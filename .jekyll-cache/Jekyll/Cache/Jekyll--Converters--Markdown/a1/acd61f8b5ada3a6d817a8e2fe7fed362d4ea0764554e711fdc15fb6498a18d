I"Î <h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>Metro Bank were the newest high street bank within the UK in over 100 years. Working with Metro Bank, I helped them launch their new internet banking platform. As UX Lead I was able to oversee the project from a strategic vision to completion of an MVP. My key mandate was to introduce user-centred methodologies and design thinking into their project process. Our resulting solution enabled Metro Bank customers to complete everyday banking tasks faster than before.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>Being a new bank with a different ethos, Metro Bank aggressively rolled out its banking products in the UK in a short space of time. This was done to very high customer satisfaction within their purposely created physical stores. The cohesion with their digital channels though, was an issue. Metro Bank recognised the limitations of their online banking from launch. It didn‚Äôt cater to their customer‚Äôs needs, and most importantly the experience of using their digital products did not reflect the brand put forward by their stores and staff.</p>

<p>Extensive customer comments through their customer service departments had confirmed key issues regarding the usability and functional limitations of their current ‚Äúoff the shelf‚Äù online banking.</p>

<p>My goal was to steer the project team in a direction dictated by current and yet to be accumulated research data. In order to achieve this, I would have to implement user-centred methodologies into to a very development heavy agile process. With buy in from the client, I was able to dictate a UX plan that would enable Metro Bank to innovate in their team, and with their customers.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>

<p>As Lead UX Consultant I was responsible for driving the creation of key deliverables, defined by creative collaboration within the project team. The challenge of remote teams, meant that workshops I prepared for and facilitated were long and intensive. The chance for the Stakeholders, Developers, Project Management and UX to be in room, had to be effective.</p>

<p>Our assumptions on our users were declared in an extensive kick-off meeting. Key customer groups were defined in collaboration with marketing and Metro Bank management. Metro Bank pride themselves on having an intimate understanding of their customers, so my approach was to explore their assumptions by bringing it back, viewing scenarios as their customer.</p>

<p>Through various game storming workshops, I was able to define the business priorities, an assumptive model of the users and the key tasks within a MVP that enabled the correct outcomes for the user. This determined a Sprint zero for myself, in addition to a skeleton for project management to solidify.</p>

<h3 id="research">Research</h3>

<p>By talking to several key stakeholders within the bank I was able to gather information about their priorities and perspectives. The role of UX was key in being able to bridge the priorities of the bank with their customers. Just for stakeholders and product owners to air grievances of the current online banking, enabled us simply to identify opportunities. A simple interview was a great way of introducing UX to them.</p>

<p>The call centre also proved an excellent <em class="highlight">listening opportunity</em> within the business. The observational insight of feedback data from a service being conducted, proved valuable in challenging several assumptions. Especially around the balance of business and user priorities.</p>

<p>The initial kick-off meeting had declared assumptions about the user. It became quite clear what was needed within a learning plan to expand the research. Key research questions revolved around the understanding of key banking tasks, and the language within those tasks. The information architecture was up for much debate, and it needed clarification.</p>

<p>One of my first research sessions with users, was to conduct a hybrid of card sorting and interview. I wanted to use a closed card sort as an ‚Äúicebreaker‚Äù. The initial objective was to get the user to group current tasks and functionality into themes that initially made sense to them. Through this I could then challenge their assumptions by getting them to walk through their choices in real world banking scenarios. This allowed me to do impromptu experience mapping as a result of the conversation. Terminology misunderstandings, process, priorities and use context all came out in these discussions.</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p>Key overarching deliverables were required at key markers in the project. By collating the research team insight into a <em class="highlight">service blueprint [Fig 4]</em> enabled me to articulate the flow of information through the service. The distributed cognition of several connected tasks and claimant characteristics, when visualised, enabled us to see where issues arose.</p>

<p>It was key that this deliverable, although useful for people to understand the service, remained lightweight and fluid. The service and digital tools were changing on a weekly basis so being precious about design deliverables wasn‚Äôt required.</p>

<p>Being onsite on a daily basis gave us the opportunity to conduct <em class="highlight">rapid prototyping</em> when landed with a problem. Impromptu sketching sessions and guerrilla testing meant we could have formulated a hypothesis, and tested it within a few days.</p>

<p>By having access to a HTML prototyping kit, or even just a few bits of paper, meant we could look at issues within the interaction and content quickly. The key to this flexibility though was having actual working staff embedded in our team. Using them as design partners meant we could constantly throw things at the wall and see if they stick.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>Co-ordinating research on site daily as a product evolves over time, gave me the opportunity to solve a lot of UX problems. The client needed to understand how their product was being used and how user needs evolved, as the product did.</p>

<p>By collecting and visualising research, I was able to bridge the service ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù to the ongoing agile development. The visualisation of that research became richer through a leadership role that facilitated design thinking within the wider project team.</p>

<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>

<p>Deciding on an effective feedback loop from research to development (remotely) is hard, and so important to be clarified at the beginning of a project. Communication lines and commitment to the prioritisation of issues that are happening right now is also a key negotiation with product owners. For me spending a bit more time at the start to define a logical plan for UX is a big learning point for me. This means clearly laid out assumptions and business objectives with their associated success metrics.</p>

<p>What surprised me in research? Get a digital tool out of the way. It needs to disappear into the background quickly. When a service is conducted face to face with people, especially when it comes to a family having enough money to live, don‚Äôt complicate the situation. The tool is there to capture the moments of a relationship between claimants and staff, not to become a frustrating dominant presence. People in stressful situations need to be treated with engagement. Not as an extended questionnaire exercise.</p>
