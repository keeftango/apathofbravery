<p>Through academic research, I was able to determine how an empathic chatbot can help users find health information. My role was to research, ideate and prototype a conversational interface in order to conduct an experiment that validated assumptions and hypotheses. As a result, I was able to determine recommendations on how a chatbot with a “personality” can improve the current experience of diagnosing health issues.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>Digital technologies, in particular the internet, have enabled people to be more informed and empowered when it comes to understanding and diagnosing their own health. How this information is sourced by the user is reflected in current behaviour of strategic keyword searching in dense online libraries and forums.</p>

<p>How users could complete these health searching tasks with “human-like” robots, mimicking human behaviour, was identified as an area of exploration through current academic thinking. A phenomenon called “cyberchondria” was highlighted, prevalent in current user behaviour. Whilst chatbots currently remain a novel interaction. The goal of this research study was to understand the impact of a chatbot, with an applied empathic personality, on user acceptance when delivering basic health information and services.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>

<p>As an all-encompassing role, I was responsible for all aspects of the study. This ranged from initial research, via ideation, to statistical and thematic analysis of experiment data.</p>

<p>Previous academia insight provided assumptions on appropriate conversational interface theory, and a methodology to approach the research questions. This generated specific hypotheses that would be challenged by quantitative and qualitative research data.</p>

<p>Adapting user-centred tools to approach conversational interfaces was a challenge. By taking the story of an experience away from a flow of screens to a human-like conversation, led to certain tweaks in my usual approach to human-centred interaction. You have to approach the deliverables form a slightly different perspective.</p>

<h3 id="research">Research</h3>

<p>To understand how people currently search for information online, particularly health issues, I conducted <em class="highlight">structured interviews</em> with several users. Themes identified in this research showed the anxieties involved in searching online, the need for specific reassurances and online research strategies utilised by people.</p>

<p>To make sense of that data and form my user model for a chatbot design, I used and adapted <em class="highlight">empathy maps</em> [Fig 1 &amp; 2] to visualise it. By having an empathy map for a user, and for a chatbot gave me the initial understanding about how the two entities in this interaction should relate.</p>

<p>Expanding out the research to <em class="highlight">map the experience</em>[Fig 3] over time gave me the opportunity to see an idealised story of how a conversational interaction would be with a chatbot. Adapting the map to illustrate what a chatbot could say during phases of a scenario provided the building blocks for subsequent design choices.</p>

<p>Understanding what personality is, and the appropriate aspects of it for the use in this context was key. The combination of academic insight on personality, empathic language and how turn-taking conversation works, gave me a range of assumptive design blocks to work with.</p>

<p>Taking scenarios from the mapping exercise, I was able to form a <em class="highlight">conversational script</em>[Fig 4] between a chatbot and a user. I started by writing things down as if I was having a conversation with a doctor. Writing out the words before applying language and emotion I felt was appropriate for that phase of the interaction. Iterating it after acting it out with another person.</p>

<p>This <em class="highlight">conversation “wireframe”</em>[Fig 5] was then formalised into a flow which considered UI choices and selection pathways. Two versions were created in order to conduct a comparative experiment. A version of a chatbot demonstrating empathic communication, and one that did not.</p>

<p>A <em class="highlight">“wizard-of-oz” prototype</em>[Fig 6] was constructed in an application named Chatfuel for both versions of the chatbot. This software replicated a Facebook Messenger conversation on a mobile. The point was to create a seemingly intelligent chatbot that could present a seemingly realistic scenario to participants in a test environment.</p>
