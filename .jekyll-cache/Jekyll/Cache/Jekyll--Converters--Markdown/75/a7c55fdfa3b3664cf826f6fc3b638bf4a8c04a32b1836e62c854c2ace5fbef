<p>As lead UX consultant I helped transition a brexit-dependant service from an EU digital system to a centralised UK government resource. This system was to be used by all UK embassies around the world for identifying and collaborating on market access barriers affecting trade. As lead within a small UX team, I helped plan, facilitate and build iterations of the service from an alpha concept to a more complex beta digital web app. With significant stakeholder management throughout, I planned and conducted international remote research across global embassies alongside the direction of service and interaction design within a large digital agile delivery team. Tough deadlines and constantly changing scope as a result.</p>
